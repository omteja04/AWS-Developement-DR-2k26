## Characteristics of the Servers

### Scalability:

**Definition**: Scalability refers to how well a system can react and adapt to changing demands. It involves adjusting resources (such as computing power, storage, or network capacity) to handle varying workloads.

### Reliability:

**Definition**: Reliability measures the ability of a system to function correctly, including avoiding data corruption.

### Availability:

**Definition**: Availability measures how often a system is accessible for use, even if it may not be functioning correctly. It ensures that customers can access cloud services whenever needed. (Zero Downtime)

## Challenges of maintaining physical servers

- Power Maintenance
- Time taken process to setup a new server 
- Difficult to achieve scalability in at all times

`Virtualization is a concept which addresses all the challenges arose by using physical servers for all things.`

Virtualization uses servers called as [Rack Servers](https://th.bing.com/th/id/OIP.WE1E1W_gWXKTnHaVnezMigHaHa?rs=1&pid=ImgDetMain).
